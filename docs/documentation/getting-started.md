```

If you wish to build MFC using [NVidia's NVHPC SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc-sdk),
first follow the instructions [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-hpc-sdk-downloads).

</details>

<details>
  <summary><h2>Windows</h2></summary>

On Windows, you can either use Intel Compilers with the standard Microsoft toolchain,
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or the
[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) for a Linux experience.

 <details>

   <summary><h3>Windows + WSL (Recommended)</h3></summary>

Install [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) on Windows 11:
Either
1. Open a terminal with administrator privileges and run the following command:
```shell
wsl --install
```
Or
1. Open the Start menu, search for "Windows Features", and select "Turn Windows features on or off". Enable "Windows Subsystem for Linux" by checking the corresponding box.
2. Open the Microsoft Store, search for "Linux", and install your preferred distribution (e.g., [Ubuntu](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/ubuntu/9PDXGNCFSCZV))

Useful software to install for using WSL on Windows:
- [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Remote - WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) extension

Once you have WSL installed, you can follow the instructions for *nix systems above (for Ubuntu, see [Via Aptitude](#via-aptitude)).

  </details>

  <details>

   <summary><h3>Native Windows (Intel)</h3></summary>

Install the latest version of:
- [Microsoft Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit
- Intel® oneAPI HPC Toolkit
- [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/) (Install and add `C:\strawberry\perl\bin\perl.exe` or your installation path to your [PATH](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/))
Please note that Visual Studio must be installed first, and the oneAPI Toolkits need to be configured with the installed Visual Studio, even if you plan to use a different IDE.

Then, to initialize your development environment, run the following command (or your installation path) in the command prompt:
```shell
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat"
```
Alternatively, you can run the following command in Powershell:
```shell
cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'
```
You could verify the initialization by typing `where mpiexec` in the command prompt terminal (does not work in Powershell), which should return the path to the Intel MPI executable.
To continue following this guide, please stay in the initialized terminal window. Replace `./mfc.sh` with `.\mfc.bat` for all commands.

If `.\mfc.bat build` produces errors, please run the command again. Repeating this process three times should resolve all errors (once each for pre_process, simulation, and post_process). If the same error persists after each attempt, please verify that you have installed all required software and properly initialized the development environment. If uncertain, you could try deleting the build directory and starting over.

You will also have access to the `.sln` Microsoft Visual Studio solution files for an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

<details>
  <summary><h3>MacOS</h3></summary>

  - **If you use [ZSH]** (Verify with `echo $SHELL`)

```shell
touch ~/.zshrc
open ~/.zshrc
```

  - **If you use [BASH]** (Verify with `echo $SHELL`)
  
```shell
touch ~/.bash_profile
open ~/.bash_profile
```
  
An editor should open.
Please paste the following lines into it before saving the file.
Modify the first assignment if you wish to use a different version of GNU's GCC.
These lines ensure that LLVM's Clang and Apple's modified version of GCC are not used to compile MFC.
Further reading on `open-mpi` incompatibility with `clang`-based `gcc` on macOS: [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27930481/how-to-build-openmpi-with-homebrew-and-gcc-4-9).
We do *not* support `clang` due to conflicts with the Silo dependency.

```shell
export MFC_GCC_VER=13
export CC=gcc-$MFC_GCC_VER
export CXX=g++-$MFC_GCC_VER
export FC=gfortran-$MFC_GCC_VER
```

**Close the open editor and terminal window**. Open a **new terminal** window before executing the commands below.

```shell
brew install wget python cmake gcc@$MFC_GCC_VER mpich
```

They will download the dependencies MFC requires to build itself.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><h3>Docker</h3></summary>

Docker is a lightweight, cross-platform, and performant alternative to Virtual Machines (VMs).
We build a Docker Image that contains the packages required to build and run MFC on your local machine.
  
First, install Docker and Git:
- Windows: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) + [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- macOS: `brew install git docker` (requires [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)).
- Other systems:
```shell
sudo apt install git docker # Debian / Ubuntu via Aptitude
sudo pacman -S git docker   # Arch Linux via Pacman
```

Once Docker and Git are installed on your system, clone MFC with

```shell
git clone https://github.com/MFlowCode/MFC
cd MFC 
```

To fetch the prebuilt Docker image and enter an interactive bash session with the
recommended settings applied, run

```shell
  ./mfc.sh  docker # If on \*nix/macOS
  .\mfc.bat docker # If on Windows
```

We automatically mount and configure the proper permissions for you to access your local copy of MFC, available at `~/MFC`.
You will be logged in as the `me` user with root permissions.

:warning: The state of your container is entirely transient, except for the MFC mount.
Thus, any modification outside of `~/MFC` should be considered permanently lost upon session exit.

## Building MFC

MFC can be built with support for various (compile-time) features:

| Feature            | Enable      | Disable        | Default | Description                                                     |
| :----------------: | :---------: | :------------: | :-----: | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **MPI**            | `--mpi`     | `--no-mpi`     | On      | Lets MFC run on multiple processors (and nodes) simultaneously. |
| **GPU**            | `--gpu`     | `--no-gpu`     | Off     | Enables GPU acceleration via OpenACC.                           |
| **Debug**          | `--debug`   | `--no-debug`   | Off     | Requests the compiler build MFC in debug mode.                  |
| **GCov**           | `--gcov`    | `--no-gcov`    | Off     | Builds MFC with coverage flags on.                              |
| **Unified Memory** | `--unified` | `--no-unified` | Off     | Builds MFC with unified CPU/GPU memory (GH-200 superchip only)  |

_⚠️ The `--gpu` option requires that your compiler supports OpenACC for Fortran for your target GPU architecture._

When these options are given to `mfc.sh`, they will be remembered when you issue future commands.
You can enable and disable features anytime by passing any of the arguments above.
For example, if you previously built MFC with MPI support and no longer wish to run using MPI, you can pass `--no-mpi` once, making the change permanent.

MFC comprises three codes, each being a separate _target_.
By default, all targets (`pre_process`, `simulation`, and `post_process`) are selected.
To only select a subset, use the `-t` (i.e., `--targets`) argument.
For a detailed list of options, arguments, and features, please refer to `./mfc.sh build --help`.

Most first-time users will want to build MFC using 8 threads (or more!) with MPI support:
```shell
./mfc.sh build -j 8
```

Examples:

- Build MFC using 8 threads with MPI and GPU acceleration: `./mfc.sh build --gpu -j 8`.
- Build MFC using a single thread without MPI, GPU, and Debug support: `./mfc.sh build --no-mpi`.
- Build MFC's `simulation` code in Debug mode with MPI and GPU support: `./mfc.sh build --debug --gpu -t simulation`.

## Running the Test Suite

Run MFC's test suite with 8 threads:

```shell
./mfc.sh test -j 8
```

Please refer to the [Testing](testing.md) document for more information.

## Running an Example Case

MFC has example cases in the `examples` folder. You can run such a case interactively using 2 tasks by typing:

```shell
./mfc.sh run examples/2D_shockbubble/case.py -n 2
```

Please refer to the [Running](running.md) document for more information on `case.py` files and how to run them.
