# Case Files

Example Python case files, also referred to as *input files*, can be found in the [examples/](https://github.com/MFlowCode/MFC/tree/master/examples) directory. They print a Python dictionary containing input parameters for MFC. Their contents, and a guide to filling them out, are documented
in the user manual. A commented, tutorial script
can also be found in [examples/3d_sphbubcollapse/](https://github.com/MFlowCode/MFC/blob/master/examples/3D_sphbubcollapse/case.py).

## Basic Skeleton

The skeleton for an input file may look like the following:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import json

# Configuring case dictionary
print(json.dumps({
  # Insert case parameters here
  ...
}))
```

Thus, you can run your case file with Python to view the computed case dictionary that will be processed by MFC when you run:

```shell
python3 my_case_file.py
```

This is particularly useful when computations are done in Python to generate the case.

## (Optional) Accepting command line arguments

Input files can accept **positional** command line arguments, forwarded by `mfc.sh run`.
Consider this example from the 3D_weak_scaling case:

```python
import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
    prog="3D_weak_scaling",
    description="This MFC case was created for the purposes of weak scaling.",
    formatter_class=argparse.ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter)

parser.add_argument("dict", type=str, metavar="DICT", help=argparse.SUPPRESS)
parser.add_argument("gbpp", type=int, metavar="MEM", default=16, help="Adjusts the problem size per rank to fit into [MEM] GB of GPU memory")

# Your parsed arguments are here
ARGS = vars(parser.parse_args())
```

The first argument is always a JSON string representing `mfc.sh run`'s internal
state.
It contains all the runtime information you might want from the build/run system.
We hide it from the help menu with `help=argparse.SUPPRESS` since it is not meant to be passed in by users.
You can add as many additional positional arguments as you may need.

To run such a case, use the following format:

```shell
./mfc.sh run <path/to/case.py> <positional arguments> <regular mfc.sh run arguments>
```

For example, to run the 3D_weak_scaling case with `gbpp=2`:

```shell
./mfc.sh run examples/3D_weak_scaling/case.py 2 -t pre_process -j 8
```

## Parameters

There are multiple sets of parameters that must be specified in the python input file:

Definition of the parameters is described in the following subsections.

### 1. Runtime

| Parameter        | Type           | Description                      |

| `run_time_info`  | Logical        | Output run-time information      |

- `run_time_info` generates a text file that includes run-time information including the CFL number(s) at each time-step.

### 2. Computational Domain

| Parameter                | Type    | Description                      |
| ---:                     | :----:  |          :---                    |
| `x[y,z]_domain%beg[end]` | Real    | Beginning [ending] of the $x$[y,z]-direction domain    |
| `stretch_x[y,z]`         | Logical | Stretching of the mesh in the $x$[y,z]-direction |
| `a_x[y,z]`               | Real    | Rate at which the grid is stretched in the $x$[y,z]-direction |
| `x[y,z]_a`               | Real    | Beginning of the stretching in the negative $x$[y,z]-direction |
| `x[y,z]_b`               | Real    | Beginning of the stretching in the positive $x$[y,z]-direction |
| `loops_x[y,z]`           | Integer | Number of times to recursively apply grid stretching |
| `cyl_coord`              | Logical | Cylindrical coordinates (2D: Axisymmetric, 3D: Cylindrical) |
| `m`                      | Integer | Number of grid cells in the $x$-coordinate direction |
| `n`                      | Integer | Number of grid cells in the $y$-coordinate direction |
| `p`                      | Integer | Number of grid cells in the $z$-coordinate direction |
| `dt`                     | Real    | Time step size |
| `t_step_start`           | Integer | Simulation starting time step |
| `t_step_stop`            | Integer | Simulation stopping time step |
| `t_step_save`            | Integer | Frequency to output data |
| `t_step_print`           | Integer | Frequency to print the current step number to standard output (default 1) |

The parameters define the boundaries of the spatial and temporal domains, and their discretization that are used in simulation.

- `[x,y,z]_domain%[beg,end]` define the spatial domain in $x$, $y$, and $z$ Cartesian coordinates:

$$ x \in \left[ x \\_ domain \\% beg, x \\_ domain \\% end \right], y \in \left[ y \\_ domain \\% beg, y \\_ domain \\% end \right], z \in \left[ z \\_ domain \\% beg, z \\_ domain \\% end \right] $$

- $m$, $n$, and $p$ define the number of finite volume cells that uniformly discretize the domain along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes, respectively.
Note that the actual number of cells in each coordinate axis is given as $[m,n,p]+1$.
For example, $m=n=p=499$ discretizes the domain into $500^3$ cells. 
When the simulation is 2D/axi-symmetric or 1D, it requires that $p=0$ or $p=n=0$, respectively.

- `stretch_[x,y,z]` activates grid stretching in the $[x,y,z]$ directions.
The grid is gradually stretched such that the domain boundaries are pushed away from the origin along a specified axis.

- `a_[x,y,z]`, `[x,y,z]_a`, and `[x,y,z]_b` are parameters that define the grid stretching function. When grid stretching along the $x$ axis is considered, the stretching function is given as:

$$ x_{cb,stretch} = x_{cb} + \frac{x_{cb}}{a_x} \Bigg[ \mathrm{log}\left[\mathrm{cosh} \left( \frac{a_x(x_{cb}-x_a)}{L} \right) \right] + \mathrm{log}\left[\mathrm{cosh} \left( \frac{a_x(x_{cb}-x_b)}{L} \right) \right] -2 \mathrm{log}\left[\mathrm{cosh} \left( \frac{a_x(x_b-x_a)}{2L} \right) \right]  \Bigg] $$

where `x_cb` and `x_[cb,stretch]` are the coordinates of a cell boundary at the original and stretched domains, respectively.
`L` is the domain length along the `x` axis: `L`=`x_domain%end`-`x_domain%beg`.
Crudely speaking, `x_a` and `x_b` define the coordinates at which the grid begins to get stretched in the negative and positive directions along the $x$ axis, respectively.
$a_x$ defines the smoothness of the stretching.
Stretching along the $y$ and $z$ axes follows the same logistics.
Optimal choice of the parameters for grid stretching is case-dependent and left to the user.
`loops_x[y,z]` defines the number of times the grid stretching function is applied and has a default value of one.

- `cyl_coord` activates cylindrical coordinates.
The domain is defined in $x$-$y$-$z$ cylindrical coordinates, instead of Cartesian coordinates.
Domain discretization is accordingly conducted along the axes of cylindrical coordinates.
When $p=0$, the domain is defined on $x$-$y$ axi-symmetric coordinates.
In both Coordinates, mesh stretching can be defined along the $x$- and $y$-axes.
MPI topology is automatically optimized to maximize the parallel efficiency for given choice of coordinate systems.

- `dt` specifies the constant time step size that is used in simulation.
The value of `dt` needs to be sufficiently small such that the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition is satisfied.

- `t_step_start` and `t_step_end` define the time steps at which simulation starts and ends, respectively.
`t_step_save` is the time step interval for data output during simulation.
To newly start the simulation, set `t_step_start = 0`.
To restart simulation from $k$-th time step, set `t_step_start = k`, do not run `pre_process`, and run `simulation` directly (`./mfc.sh run [...] -t simulation`).
Ensure the data for the $k$-th time step is stored in the `restart_data/` directory within the case repository.

*: These parameters should be prepended with `patch_icpp(j)%` where $j$ is the patch index. 

The Table lists the patch parameters.
The parameters define the geometries and physical parameters of fluid components (patch) in the domain at initial condition.
Note that the domain must be fully filled with patche(s).
The code outputs error messages when an empty region is left in the domain.

#### Analytical Definition of Primitive Variables

Some parameters, as described above, can be defined by analytical functions in the input file. For example, one can define the following patch:

```shell
'patch_icpp(2)%geometry'    : 15,
'patch_icpp(2)%x_centroid'  : 0.25,
'patch_icpp(2)%length_x'    : 9.5,
'patch_icpp(2)%vel(1)'      : 0.,
'patch_icpp(2)%pres'        : 1.,
'patch_icpp(2)%alpha_rho(1)': '1 + 0.1*sin(20*x*pi)',
'patch_icpp(2)%alpha(1)'    : 1.,
```

where `alpha_rho` is defined with the `1 + 0.1*sin(20*x*pi)` function. 

The expressions are interpreted as Fortran code, in the execution context and scope of the function that defines the patch.
Additionally, the following variables are made available as shorthand:

| Shorthand | Expands To               | Shorthand | Expands To                | Shorthand | Expands To               |
| --------- | ------------------------ | --------- | ------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------ |
| `x`       | `x_cc(i)`                | `lx`      | The patch's `length_x`    | `xc`      | The patch's `x_centroid` |
| `y`       | `y_cc(j)`                | `ly`      | The patch's `length_y`    | `yc`      | The patch's `y_centroid` |
| `z`       | `z_cc(k)`                | `lz`      | The patch's `length_z`    | `zc`      | The patch's `z_centroid` |
| `eps`     | The patch's `epsilon`    | `beta`    | The patch's `beta`        | `radii`   | The patch's `radii`      |
| `tau_e`   | The patch's `tau_e`      | `r`       | The patch's `radius`      | `pi` and `e` | $\pi$ and $e$         |

where $(i,j,k)$ are the grid-indices of the current cell in each coordinate direction.

In the example above, the following code is generated:

```f90
if (patch_id == 2) then
    q_prim_vf(contxb)%sf(i, 0, 0) = 1 + 0.1*sin(20*x_cc(i)*3.141592653589793)
end if
```

#### Hard Coded Patches

Some patch configurations are not adequately handled with the above analytic variable definitions.
In this case, a hard coded patch can be used.
Hard coded patches can be added by adding additional hard coded patch identifiers to `src/pre_process/include/1[2,3]dHardcodedIC.fpp`.
For example, to add a 2D Hardcoded patch with an id of 200, one would add the following to `src/pre_process/include/2dHardcodedIC.fpp`

```f90
    case(200)
        ! Primitive variables assignment
```

and use `patch_icpp(i)%geometry = 7` and `patch_icpp(i)%hcid = 200` in the input file.
Additional variables can be declared in `Hardcoded1[2,3]DVariables` and used in `hardcoded1[2,3]D`.
As a convention, any hard coded patches that are part of the MFC master branch should be identified as 1[2,3]xx where the first digit indites the number of dimensions.

#### Parameter Descriptions

- `num_patches` defines the total number of patches defined in the domain.
The number has to be a positive integer.

- `num_fluids` defines the total number of fluids defined in each of the patches.
The number has to be a positive integer.

- `patch_icpp(j)%geometry` defines the type of geometry of $j$-th patch by using an integer from 1 to 13.
Definition of the patch type for each integer is listed in table [Patch Types](#patch-types).

- `[x,y,z]_centroid`, `length_[x,y,z]`, and/or `radius` are used to uniquely define the geometry of the patch with given type.
Requisite combinations of the parameters for each type can be found in is listed in table [Patch types](#patch-types).

- `patch_icpp(j)%alter_patch(i)` activates alternation of `patch(i)` with `patch(j)`.
For instance, in a 2D simulation, when a cylindrical `patch(2)` is immersed in a rectangular `patch(1)`:
  - `patch_icpp(1)%geometry`=3
  - `patch_icpp(2)%geometry`=2
  - `patch_icpp(2)%alter_patch(1)`=TRUE

- `smoothen` activates smoothening of the boundary of the patch that alters the existing patch.
When smoothening occurs, fluids of the two patches are mixed in the region of the boundary.
For instance, in the aforementioned case of the cylindrical patch immersed in the rectangular patch, smoothening occurs when `patch_icpp(2)smoothen`=TRUE.
`smooth_coeff` controls the thickness of the region of smoothening (sharpness of the mixture region).
The default value of `smooth_coeff` is unity. The region of smoothening is thickened with decreasing the value.
Optimal choice of the value of `smooth_coeff` is case-dependent and left to the user.

- `patch_icpp(j)alpha(i)`, `patch_icpp(j)alpha_rho(i)`, `patch_icpp(j)pres`, and `texttt{patch_icpp(j)vel(i)` define for $j$-th patch the void fraction of `fluid(i)`, partial density of `fluid(i)`, the pressure, and the velocity in the $i$-th coordinate direction.
These physical parameters must be consistent with fluid material's parameters defined in the next subsection.
See also `adv_alphan` in table [Simulation Algorithm Parameters](#5-simulation-algorithm).

- 'model%scale', 'model%rotate` and `model%translate` define how the model should be transformed to domain-space by first scaling by `model%scale`, then rotating about the Z, X, and Y axes (using `model%rotate`), and finally translating by `model%translate`.

| Parameter            | Type    | Analytical Definition Description |
| ---:                 | :----:  | :----:                | 
| `geometry`             | Integer | Geometry configuration of the patch.|
| `x[y,z]_centroid`      | Real    | Centroid of the applied geometry in the [x,y,z]-direction. |
| `length_x[y,z]`        | Real    | Length, if applicable, in the [x,y,z]-direction. |
| `radius`               | Real    | Radius, if applicable, of the applied geometry. |
| `theta`                | Real    | Angle of attach applied to airfoil IB patches |
| `c`                    | Real    | 
| `t`                    | Real    |
| `m`                    | Real    | 
| `p`                    | Real    |
| `slip`                 | Logical | Apply a slip boundary |

These parameters should be prepended with `patch_ib(j)%` where $j$ is the patch index. 

#### Parameter Descriptions

- `geometry` defines the type of geometry of a patch with an integer number.
Definitions for currently implemented patch types are list in table [Immersed Boundary Patch Type](#immersed-boundary-patch-types)

- `x[y,z]_centroid` is the centroid location of the patch in the x[y,z]-direction

- `length_x[y,z]` is the length of the patch in the x[y,z]-direction.

- `radius` is the radius to be used for circular patches.

- `theta` allows for the angle of attach of airfoil patches to be changed.

- `c`, `t`, `p`, and `m` specify the parameters for a NACA airfoil.
`m` is the maximum camber, `p` is the location of maximum camber, `c` is the coord length, and `t` is the thickness.
Additional details on this specification can be found in [The Naca Airfoil Series](https://web.stanford.edu/~cantwell/AA200_Course_Material/The%20NACA%20airfoil%20series.pdf)

- `slip` applies a slip boundary to the surface of the patch if true and a no-slip boundary condition to the surface if false.

### 5. Fluid Material’s

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                    |
| ---:      | :----: |          :---                                  |

| `Re(2)` * | Real   | Volume viscosity of fluid.                     |
| `cv`   ** | Real   | Sffened-gas parameter $c_v$ of fluid.          |
| `qv`   ** | Real   | Stiffened-gas parameter $q$ of fluid.          |
| `qvp`  ** | Real   | Stiffened-gas parameter $q'$ of fluid.         |
| `sigma`   | Real   | Surface tension coefficient                    |

Fluid material's parameters. All parameters except for sigma should be prepended with `fluid_pp(i)` where $i$ is the fluid index.

*: Parameters that work only with `model_eqns`=2.

**: Parameters that work only with `model_eqns`=3.

The table lists the fluid material's parameters.
The parameters define material's property of compressible fluids that are used in simulation.

- `fluid_pp(i)%gamma` and `fluid_pp(i)%pi_inf` define $\Gamma$ and $\Pi$ as parameters of $i$-th fluid that are used in stiffened gas equation of state.

- `fluid_pp(i)%Re(1)` and `fluid_pp(i)%Re(2)` define the shear and volume viscosities of $i$-th fluid, respectively.

When these parameters are undefined, fluids are treated as inviscid.
Details of implementation of viscosity in MFC can be found in [Coralic (2015)](references.md#Coralic15).

- `fluid_pp(i)%cv`, `fluid_pp(i)%qv`, and `fluid_pp(i)%qvp` define $c_v$, $q$, and $q'$ as parameters of $i$-th fluid that are used in stiffened gas equation of state.

- \* Options that work only with `model_eqns =2`.
- † Options that work only with `cyl_coord = 'F'`.
- ‡ Options that work only with `bc_[x,y,z]%[beg,end] = -15` and/or `bc_[x,y,z]%[beg,end] = -16`

The table lists simulation algorithm parameters.
The parameters are used to specify options in algorithms that are used to integrate the governing equations of the multi-component flow based on the initial condition.
Models and assumptions that are used to formulate and discritize the governing equations are described in [Bryngelson et al. (2019)](references.md#Bryngelson19).
Details of the simulation algorithms and implementation of the WENO scheme can be found in [Coralic (2015)](references.md#Coralic15).

- `bc_[x,y,z]%[beg,end]` specifies the boundary conditions at the beginning and the end of domain boundaries in each coordinate direction by a negative integer from -1 through -12.
See table [Boundary Conditions](#boundary-conditions) for details.

- `bc_[x,y,z]\%vb[1,2,3]` specifies the velocity in the (x,1), (y,2), (z,3) direction applied to `bc_[x,y,z]%beg` when using `bc_[x,y,z]%beg = -16`.
Tangential velocities require viscosity, `weno_avg = T`, and `bc_[x,y,z]%beg = -16` to work properly. Normal velocities require `bc_[x,y,z]\%end = -15` or `\bc_[x,y,z]\%end = -16` to work properly.

- `bc_[x,y,z]\%ve[1,2,3]` specifies the velocity in the (x,1), (y,2), (z,3) direction applied to `bc_[x,y,z]%beg` when using `bc_[x,y,z]%end = -16`.
Tangential velocities require viscosity, `weno_avg = T`, and `bc_[x,y,z]\%end = 16` to work properly. Normal velocities require `bc_[x,y,z]\%end = -15` or `\bc_[x,y,z]\%end = -16` to work properly.

- `model_eqns` specifies the choice of the multi-component model that is used to formulate the dynamics of the flow using integers from 1 through 3. 
`model_eqns = 1`, `2`, and `3` correspond to $\Gamma$-$\Pi_\infty$ model ([Johnsen, 2008](references.md#Johnsen08)), 5-equation model ([Allaire et al., 2002](references.md#Allaire02)), and 6-equation model ([Saurel et al., 2009](references.md#Saurel09)), respectively.
The difference of the two models is assessed by ([Schmidmayer et al., 2019](references.md#Schmidmayer19)).
Note that some code parameters are only compatible with 5-equation model.

- `alt_soundspeed` activates the source term in the advection equations for the volume fractions, $K\nabla\cdot \underline{u}$, that regularizes the speed of sound in the mixture region when the 5-equation model is used.
The effect and use of the source term are assessed by [Schmidmayer et al., 2019](references.md#Schmidmayer19).

- `adv_alphan` activates the advection equations of all the components of fluid.
If this parameter is set false, the void fraction of $N$-th component is computed as the residual of the void fraction of the other components at each cell:

$$ \alpha_N=1-\sum^{N-1}_{i=1} \alpha_i $$

where $\alpha_i$ is the void fraction of $i$-th component.
When a single-component flow is simulated, it requires that `adv_alphan = 'T'`.

- `adv_n` activates the direct computation of number density by the Riemann solver instead of computing number density from the void fraction in the method of classes.

- `mpp_lim` activates correction of solutions to avoid a negative void fraction of each component in each grid cell, such that $\alpha_i>\varepsilon$ is satisfied at each time step.

- `mixture_err` activates correction of solutions to avoid imaginary speed of sound at each grid cell.

- `time_stepper` specifies the order of the Runge-Kutta (RK) time integration scheme that is used for temporal integration in simulation, from the 1st to 5th order by corresponding integer. 
Note that `time_stepper = 3` specifies the total variation diminishing (TVD), third order RK scheme ([Gottlieb and Shu, 1998](references.md#Gottlieb98)).

- `adap_dt` activates the Strang operator splitting scheme which splits flux and source terms in time marching, and an adaptive time stepping strategy is implemented for the source term. It requires `bubbles = 'T'`, `polytropic = 'T'`, `adv_n = 'T'` and `time_stepper = 3`.

- `weno_order` specifies the order of WENO scheme that is used for spatial reconstruction of variables by an integer of 1, 3, and 5, that correspond to the 1st, 3rd, and 5th order, respectively.

- `weno_eps` specifies the lower bound of the WENO nonlinear weights.
Practically, `weno_eps` $<10^{-6}$ is used.

- `mapped_weno` activates mapping of the nonlinear WENO weights to the more accurate nonlinear weights in order to reinstate the optimal order of accuracy of the reconstruction in the proximity of critical points ([Henrick et al., 2005](references.md#Henrick05)).

- `null_weights` activates nullification of the nonlinear WENO weights at the buffer regions outside the domain boundaries when the Riemann extrapolation boundary condition is specified (`bc_[x,y,z]\%beg[end]} = -4`).

- `mp_weno` activates monotonicity preservation in the WENO reconstruction (MPWENO) such that the values of reconstructed variables do not reside outside the range spanned by WENO stencil ([Balsara and Shu, 2000](references.md#Balsara00); [Suresh and Huynh, 1997](references.md#Suresh97)).

- `riemann_solver` specifies the choice of the Riemann solver that is used in simulation by an integer from 1 through 3.
`riemann_solver = 1`, `2`, and `3` correspond to HLL, HLLC, and Exact Riemann solver, respectively ([Toro, 2013](references.md#Toro13)).

- `avg_state` specifies the choice of the method to compute averaged variables at the cell-boundaries from the left and the right states in the Riemann solver by an integer of 1 or 2.
`avg_state = 1` and `2` correspond to Roe- and arithmetic averages, respectively.

- `wave_speeds` specifies the choice of the method to compute the left, right, and middle wave speeds in the Riemann solver by an integer of 1 and 2.
`wave_speeds = 1` and `2` correspond to the direct method ([Batten et al., 1997](references.md#Batten97)), and indirect method that approximates the pressures and velocity ([Toro, 2013](references.md#Toro13)), respectively.

- `weno_Re_flux` activates the scaler divergence theorem in computing the velocity gradients using WENO-reconstructed cell boundary values.
If this option is false, velocity gradient is computed using finite difference scheme of order 2 which is independent of the WENO order.

- `weno_avg` it activates the arithmetic average of the left and right, WENO-reconstructed, cell-boundary values.
This option requires `weno_Re_flux` to be true because cell boundary values are only utilized when employing the scalar divergence method in the computation of velocity gradients.

- `file_per_process` deactivates shared file MPI-IO and activates file per process MPI-IO.
The default behavior is to use a shared file.
File per process is useful when running on 10's of thousands of ranks.

The source plane is defined in the finite region of the domain: $x\in[-\infty,\infty]$ and $y,z\in$[-`mymono_length`/2, `mymono_length`/2].

| `bf_x[y,z]`       | Logical | Enable body forces in the x[y,z] direction |
| `k_x[y,y]`        | Real    | Magnitude of oscillating acceleration      |
| `w_x[y,z]`        | Real    | Frequency of oscillating acceleration      |
| `p_x[y,z]`        | Real    | Phase shift of oscillating acceleration    |
| `g_x[y,z]`        | Real    | Magnitude of bacground acceleration        |

`k_x[y,z]`, `w_x[y,z]`, `p_x[y,z]`, and `g_x[y,z]` define an oscillating acceleration in the `x[y,z]` direction with the form

$$ a_{x[y,z]} = g_{x[y,z]} + k_{x[y,z]}\sin\left(w_{x[y,z]}t + p_{x[y,z]}\right). $$

Positive accelerations are in the `x[y,z]` direction are in the positive `x[y,z]` direction by convention.

## Enumerations

### Boundary conditions

*: This boundary condition is only used for `bc_y%beg` when using cylindrical coordinates (`cyl_coord = 'T'` and 3D). For axisymmetric problems, use `bc_y%beg = -2` with `cyl_coord = 'T'` in 2D.

The boundary condition supported by the MFC are listed in table [Boundary Conditions](#boundary-conditions).
Their number (`#`) corresponds to the input value in `input.py` labeled `bc_[x,y,z]%[beg,end]` (see table [Simulation Algorithm Parameters](#5-simulation-algorithm)).
The entries labeled "Characteristic." are characteristic boundary conditions based on [Thompson (1987)](references.md#Thompson87) and [Thompson (1990)](references.md#Thompson90).

The patch types supported by the MFC are listed in table [Patch Types](#patch-types).
This includes types exclusive to one-, two-, and three-dimensional problems.
The patch type number (`#`) corresponds to the input value in `input.py` labeled  `patch_icpp(j)%geometry` where $j$ is the patch index.
Each patch requires a different set of parameters, which are also listed in this table.
