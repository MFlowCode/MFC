# Running

MFC can be run using `mfc.sh`'s `run` command.
It supports interactive and batch execution.
Batch mode is designed for multi-node distributed systems (supercomputers) equipped with a scheduler such as PBS, SLURM, or LSF.
A full (and up-to-date) list of available arguments can be acquired with `./mfc.sh run -h`.

MFC supports running simulations locally (Linux, MacOS, and Windows) as well as
several supercomputer clusters, both interactively and through batch submission.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Running simulations locally should work out of the box. On supported clusters,
> you can append `-c <computer name>` on the command line to instruct the MFC toolchain
> to make use of the template file `toolchain/templates/<computer name>.mako`. You can
> browse that directory and contribute your own files. Since systems and their schedulers
> do not have a standardized syntax to request certain resources, MFC can only provide
> support for a restricted subset of common or user-contributed configuration options.
>
> Adding a new template file or modifying an existing one will most likely be required if:
> - You are on a cluster that does not have a template yet.
> - Your cluster is configured with SLURM, but interactive job launches fail when
>   using `srun`. You might need to invoke `mpirun` instead.
> - Something in the existing default or computer template file is incompatible with
>   your system or does not provide a feature you need.
>
> If `-c <computer name>` is left unspecified, it defaults to `-c default`.

Please refer to `./mfc.sh run -h` for a complete list of arguments and options, along with their defaults.

## Interactive Execution

To run all stages of MFC, that is [pre_process](https://github.com/MFlowCode/MFC/tree/master/src/pre_process/), [simulation](https://github.com/MFlowCode/MFC/tree/master/src/simulation/), and [post_process](https://github.com/MFlowCode/MFC/tree/master/src/post_process/) on the sample case [2D_shockbubble](https://github.com/MFlowCode/MFC/tree/master/examples/2D_shockbubble/),

```shell
./mfc.sh run examples/2D_shockbubble/case.py
```

If you want to run a subset of the available stages, you can use the `-t` argument.
To use multiple threads, use the `-n` option along with the number of threads you wish to use.
If a (re)build is required, it will be done automatically, with the number of threads
specified with the `-j` option.

For example,

- Running [pre_process](https://github.com/MFlowCode/MFC/tree/master/src/pre_process/) with 2 cores:

```shell
./mfc.sh run examples/2D_shockbubble/case.py -t pre_process -n 2
```

- Running [simulation](https://github.com/MFlowCode/MFC/tree/master/src/simulation/) and [post_process](https://github.com/MFlowCode/MFC/tree/master/src/post_process/)
using 4 cores:

```shell
./mfc.sh run examples/2D_shockbubble/case.py -t simulation post_process -n 4
```

## Batch Execution

The MFC detects which scheduler your system is using and handles the creation and execution of batch scripts.
The batch engine is requested via the `-e batch` option.
The number of nodes can be specified with the `-N` (i.e., `--nodes`) option.

We provide a list of (baked-in) submission batch scripts in the `toolchain/templates` folder.

```shell
./mfc.sh run examples/2D_shockbubble/case.py -e batch -N 2 -n 4 -t simulation -c <computer name>
```

Other useful arguments include:

- `-# <job name>` to name your job. (i.e., `--name`)
- `-@ sample@example.com` to receive emails from the scheduler. (i.e., `--email`)
- `-w hh:mm:ss` to specify the job's maximum allowed walltime. (i.e., `--walltime`)
- `-a <account name>` to identify the account to be charged for the job. (i.e., `--account`)
- `-p <partition name>` to select the job's partition. (i.e., `--partition`)

As an example, one might request GPUs on a SLURM system using the following:

**Disclaimer**: IBM's JSRUN on LSF-managed computers does not use the traditional node-based approach to
allocate resources. Therefore, the MFC constructs equivalent resource sets in the task and GPU count.

### GPU Profiling 

#### NVIDIA GPUs

MFC provides two different arguments to facilitate profiling with NVIDIA Nsight.
**Please ensure the used argument is placed at the end so their respective flags can be appended.**
- Nsight Systems (Nsys): `./mfc.sh run ... -t simulation --nsys [nsys flags]` allows one to visualize MFC's system-wide performance with [NVIDIA Nsight Systems](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems).
NSys is best for understanding the order and execution times of major subroutines (WENO, Riemann, etc.) in MFC.
When used, `--nsys` will run the simulation and generate `.nsys-rep` files in the case directory for all targets.
These files can then be imported into Nsight System's GUI, which can be downloaded [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems/get-started#latest-Platforms). To keep the report files small, it is best to run case files with a few timesteps. Learn more about NVIDIA Nsight Systems [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-systems/UserGuide/index.html).
- Nsight Compute (NCU): `./mfc.sh run ... -t simulation --ncu [ncu flags]` allows one to conduct kernel-level profiling with [NVIDIA Nsight Compute](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-compute).
NCU provides profiling information for every subroutine called and is more detailed than NSys.
When used, `--ncu` will output profiling information for all subroutines, including elapsed clock cycles, memory used, and more after the simulation is run.
Adding this argument will significantly slow the simulation and should only be used on case files with a few timesteps.
Learn more about NVIDIA Nsight Compute [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/NsightCompute/index.html).


#### AMD GPUs
- Rocprof (ROC): `./mfc.sh run ... -t simulation --roc --hip-trace [rocprof flags]` allows one to visualize MFC's system-wide performance with [Perfetto UI](https://ui.perfetto.dev/).
When used, `--roc` will run the simulation and generate files in the case directory for all targets.
`results.json` can then be imported in [Perfetto's UI](https://ui.perfetto.dev/).
Learn more about AMD Rocprof [here](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler/en/docs-5.5.1/rocprof.html)
It is best to run case files with few timesteps to keep the report file sizes manageable.
- Omniperf (OMNI): `./mfc.sh run ... -t simulation --omni [omniperf flags]` allows one to conduct kernel-level profiling with [AMD Omniperf](https://rocm.github.io/omniperf/introduction.html#what-is-omniperf).
When used, `--omni` will output profiling information for all subroutines, including rooflines, cache usage, register usage, and more, after the simulation is run.
Adding this argument will moderately slow down the simulation and run the MFC executable several times.
For this reason, it should only be used with case files with few timesteps.


### Restarting Cases

When running a simulation, MFC generates a `./restart_data` folder in the case directory that contains `lustre_*.dat` files that can be used to restart a simulation from saved timesteps.
This allows a user to simulate some timestep $X$, then continue it to run to another timestep $Y$, where $Y > X$.
The user can also choose to add new patches at the intermediate timestep.

If you want to restart a simulation, 

- Set up the initial simulation, with:
    - `t_step_start` : $t_i$
    - `t_step_stop`  : $t_f$
    - `t_step_save`  : $SF$
in which $t_i$ is the starting time, $t_f$ is the final time, and $SF$ is the saving frequency time.
- Run `pre_process` and `simulation` on the case.
    - `./mfc.sh run case.py -t pre_process simulation `
- As the simulation runs, Lustre files will be created for each saved timestep in `./restart_data`.
- When the simulation stops, choose any Lustre file as the restarting point (lustre_ $t_s$.dat)
- Create a new duplicate input file (e.g., `restart_case.py`), which should have:

1. For the Computational Domain Parameters 
    - Have the following removed __except__ `m`, `n`, and `p`:
		- All domain/mesh information
			- `(xyz)_domain%beg`
			- `(xyz)_domain%end`
			- `stretch_(xyz)`
			- `a_(xyz)`
			- `(xyz)_a`
			- `(xyz)_b`
	- Alter the following:
		- `t_step_start` : $t_s$ (the point at which the simulation will restart)
		- `t_step_stop`  : $t_{f2}$ (new final simulation time, which can be the same as $t_f$)
		- `t_step_save`  : ${SF}_2$ (if interested in changing the saving frequency)
	- Add the following:
		- `old_ic` : 'T' (to specify that we have initial conditions from previous simulations)
		- `old_grid` : 'T' (to specify that we have a grid from previous simulations)
		- `t_step_old` : $t_i$ (the time step used as the `t_step_start` of the original `case.py` file)
2. For the Simulation Algorithm Parameters
	- Substitute `num_patches` to reflect the number of ADDED patches in the `restart_case.py` file. If no patches are added, set `num_patches: 0`

3. For Patches
	- Have all information about old patches (used in the `case.py` file) removed.
		- `patch_icpp(1)%all variables`
		- `patch_icpp(2)%all variables`
		- `patch_icpp(num_patches)%all variables`
	- Add information about new patches that will be introduced, if any. The parameter num_patches should reflect this addition.
		- e.g. `patch_icpp(1)%some variables of interest`	

4. For Fluid properties	
	- Keep information about the fluid properties

- Run pre-process and simulation on `restart_case.py`
    - `./mfc.sh run restart_case.py -t pre_process simulation `
	
- Run the post_process
	- There are several ways to do this. Keep in mind that, regardless of the .py file used, the post_process command will generate output files in the [`t_step_start`, `t_step_stop`] range, with `t_step_save` as the spacing between files.
	- One way is to set `t_step_stop` to the restarting point $t_s$ in `case.py`. Then, run the commands below. The first command will run on timesteps $[t_i, t_s]$. The second command will run on $[t_s, t_{f2}]$. Therefore, the whole range $[t_i, t_{f2}]$ will be post processed.

```shell
./mfc.sh run case.py -t post_process
./mfc.sh run restart_case.py -t post_process
```	

We have provided an example, `case.py` and `restart_case.py` in `/examples/1D_vacuum_restart/`. This simulation is a duplicate of the `1D_vacuum` case. It demonstrates stopping at timestep 7000, adding a new patch, and restarting the simulation. To test this code, run:

```shell
./mfc.sh run examples/1D_vacuum_restart/case.py -t pre_process simulation
./mfc.sh run examples/1D_vacuum_restart/restart_case.py -t pre_process simulation
./mfc.sh run examples/1D_vacuum_restart/case.py -t post_process
./mfc.sh run examples/1D_vacuum_restart/restart_case.py -t post_process
```

### Example Runs
