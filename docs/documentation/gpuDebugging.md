# Debugging Tools and Tips for GPUs

## Compiler agnostic tools

## OpenMP tools
```bash
OMP_DISPLAY_ENV=true | false | verbose
```
- Prints out the internal control values and environment variables at the beginning of the program if `true` or `verbose`
- `verbose` will also print out vendor-specific internal control values and environment variables

```bash
OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD = MANDATORY | DISABLED | DEFAULT
```
- Quick way to turn off off-load (`DISABLED`) or make it abort if a GPU isn't found (`MANDATORY`)
- Great first test: does the problem disappear when you drop back to the CPU? 

```bash
OMP_THREAD_LIMIT=<positive_integer>
```
- Sets the maximum number of OpenMP threads to use in a contention group
- Might be useful in checking for issues with contention or race conditions

```bash
OMP_DISPLAY_AFFINITY=TRUE
```
- Will display affinity bindings for each OpenMP thread, containing hostname, process identifier, OS thread identifier, OpenMP thread identifier, and affinity binding.

## Cray Compiler Tools

### Cray General Options

```bash
CRAY_ACC_DEBUG: 0 (off), 1, 2, 3 (very noisy)
```

- Dumps a time-stamped log line (`ACC: ...`) for every allocation, data transfer, kernel launch, wait, etc. Great first stop when "nothing seems to run on the GPU".
- Outputs on STDERR by default. Can be changed by setting `CRAY_ACC_DEBUG_FILE`.
  - Recognizes `stderr`, `stdout`, and `process`.
  - `process` automatically generates a new file based on `pid` (each MPI process will have a different file)
- While this environment variable specifies ACC, it can be used for both OpenACC and OpenMP

```bash
CRAY_ACC_FORCE_EARLY_INIT=1
```

- Force full GPU initialization at program start so you can see start-up hangs immediately
- Default behavior without an environment variable is to defer initialization on first use
- Device initialization includes initializing the GPU vendor’s low-level device runtime library (e.g., libcuda for NVIDIA GPUs) and establishing all necessary software contexts for interacting with the device

### Cray OpenACC Options

```bash
CRAY_ACC_PRESENT_DUMP_SAVE_NAMES=1
```
- Will cause `acc_present_dump()` to output variable names and file locations in addition to variable mappings
- Add `acc_present_dump()` around hotspots to help find problems with data movements
  - Helps more if adding `CRAY_ACC_DEBUG` environment variable

## NVHPC Compiler Options

### NVHPC General Options

```bash
STATIC_RANDOM_SEED=1
```
- Forces the seed returned by `RANDOM_SEED` to be constant, so it generates the same sequence of random numbers 
- Useful for testing issues with randomized data

```bash
NVCOMPILER_TERM=option[,option]
```
- `[no]debug`: Enables/disables just-in-time debugging (debugging invoked on error)
- `[no]trace`: Enables/disables stack traceback on error

### NVHPC OpenACC Options

```bash
NVCOMPILER_ACC_NOTIFY= <bitmask>
```
- Assign the environment variable to a bitmask to print out information to stderr for the following
  - kernel launches: 1
  - data transfers: 2
  - region entry/exit: 4
  - wait operation of synchronizations with the device: 8
  - device memory allocations and deallocations: 16
- 1 (kernels only) is the usual first step.3 (kernels + copies) is great for "why is it so slow?" 

```bash
NVCOMPILER_ACC_TIME=1
```
- Lightweight profiler
- prints a tidy end-of-run table with per-region and per-kernel times and bytes moved
- Do not use with CUDA profiler at the same time

```bash
NVCOMPILER_ACC_DEBUG=1
```
- Spews everything the runtime sees: host/device addresses, mapping events, present-table look-ups, etc.
- Great for "partially present" or "pointer went missing" errors. 
- [Doc for NVCOMPILER_ACC_DEBUG](https://docs.nvidia.com/hpc-sdk/archive/20.9/pdf/hpc209openacc_gs.pdf)
  - Ctrl+F for `NVCOMPILER_ACC_DEBUG`

### NVHPC OpenMP Options

```bash
LIBOMPTARGET_PROFILE=run.json
```
- Emits a Chrome-trace (JSON) timeline you can open in chrome://tracing or Speedscope
- Great lightweight profiler when Nsight is overkill.
- Granularity in µs via `LIBOMPTARGET_PROFILE_GRANULARITY` (default 500).

```bash
LIBOMPTARGET_INFO=<bitmask>
```
- Prints out different types of runtime information
- Human-readable log of data-mapping inserts/updates, kernel launches, copies, waits.
- Perfect first stop for "why is nothing copied?" 
- Flags
  - Print all data arguments upon entering an OpenMP device kernel: 0x01
  - Indicate when a mapped address already exists in the device mapping table: 0x02
  - Dump the contents of the device pointer map at kernel exit: 0x04
  - Indicate when an entry is changed in the device mapping table: 0x08
  - Print OpenMP kernel information from device plugins: 0x10
  - Indicate when data is copied to and from the device: 0x20

```bash
LIBOMPTARGET_DEBUG=1
```
- Developer-level trace (host-side)
- Much noisier than `INFO`
- Only works if the runtime was built with `-DOMPTARGET_DEBUG`.

```bash
LIBOMPTARGET_JIT_OPT_LEVEL=-O{0,1,2,3}
```
- This environment variable can be used to change the optimization pipeline used to optimize the embedded device code as part of the device JIT. 
- The value corresponds to the `-O{0,1,2,3}` command line argument passed to clang.

```bash
LIBOMPTARGET_JIT_SKIP_OPT=1
```
- This environment variable can be used to skip the optimization pipeline during JIT compilation.
- If set, the image will only be passed through the backend.
- The backend is invoked with the `LIBOMPTARGET_JIT_OPT_LEVEL` flag.
