Project context and review priorities: .github/copilot-instructions.md
Coding standards and common pitfalls: docs/documentation/contributing.md
GPU macro API: docs/documentation/gpuParallelization.md

Prioritize correctness over style (formatting is enforced by pre-commit hooks).
Key areas: logic bugs, numerical issues,
array bounds (non-unity lower bounds with ghost cells),
domain transposition bugs (Y/Z sweeps reorder indices), MPI halo exchange
correctness (pack/unpack offsets, GPU data coherence), precision mixing
(stp vs wp), ALLOCATE/DEALLOCATE pairing (GPU memory leaks), physics model
consistency (pressure formula must match model_eqns), missing case_validator.py
constraints for new parameters, and compiler portability across all four
supported compilers.
