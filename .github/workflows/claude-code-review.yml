            Post the results as ONE top-level PR comment titled "Claude Code Review".

            Output requirements (even if no issues):
            - Start with: files changed count + list up to 15 changed file paths
            - Then: a short summary of what the PR changes (3–6 bullets)
            - Then: findings:
              - If issues: list them with file path + line numbers when possible
              - If no issues: list at least 3 concrete "improvement opportunities" with file paths

            If you cannot access the diff/files, say exactly what is blocked.
            If posting a PR comment is blocked, write the full review to the GitHub Actions job summary instead.

            IMPORTANT:
            - Do NOT stop just because a previous "Claude Code Review" comment exists.
            - If a prior Claude review exists, post a NEW comment titled "Claude Code Review (updated)" that includes:
              - current head SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
              - files changed count + up to 15 file paths
              - 3–6 bullet summary of changes
              - findings or at least 3 improvement opportunities with file paths
            Post as ONE top-level PR comment.
