!> @brief The post-process restructures raw unformatted data, outputted by
!!              the simulation, into a formatted database, Silo-HDF5 or Binary,
!!              chosen by the user. The user may also specify which variables to
!!              include in the database. The choices range from any one of the
!!              primitive and conservative variables, as well as quantities that
!!              can be derived from those such as the unadvected volume fraction,
!!              specific heat ratio, liquid stiffness, speed of sound, vorticity
!!              and the numerical Schlieren function.
