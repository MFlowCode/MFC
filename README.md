  Welcome to the home of MFC!
  MFC simulates compressible multi-component and multi-phase flows, amongst other things. 
  It scales <b>ideally to exascale</b>; tens of thousands of GPUs on NVIDIA- and AMD-GPU Machines, like Oak Ridge Summit and Frontier.
  MFC is written in Fortran and makes use of metaprogramming to keep the code short (about 20K lines).
  
  Get in touch with the maintainers, like <a href="mailto:shb@gatech.edu">Spencer</a>, if you have questions!
  We have an active Slack channel and development team.
  MFC has high-level documentation, visualizations, and more on [its website](https://mflowcode.github.io/).
</p>

## An example

We keep many examples.
Here's one!
MFC can execute high-fidelity simulations of shock-droplet interaction (see `examples/3d_shockdroplet`)

</p>

## Getting started

You can navigate [to this webpage](https://mflowcode.github.io/documentation/md_getting-started.html) to get started using MFC!
It's rather straightforward.

We'll give a brief intro. here for MacOS.
Using [brew](https://brew.sh), install MFC's modest set of dependencies:
```console
brew install wget make python make cmake coreutils gcc openmpi
```
You're now ready to build and test MFC!
Clone it to a convenient directory via
```console
git clone https://github.com/mflowcode/MFC.git
cd MFC
```
then build and test!
```console
./mfc.sh build -j 8
./mfc.sh test -j 8
```
And... you're done!

You can learn more about MFC's capabilities [via its documentation](https://mflowcode.github.io/documentation/index.html) or play with the examples located in the `examples/` directory (some are [shown here](https://mflowcode.github.io/documentation/md_examples.html))!

The shock-droplet interaction case above was run via
```console
./mfc.sh run ./examples/3d_shockdroplet/case.py -n 8
```
where `8` is the number of cores the example will run on.
You can visualize the output data, located in `examples/3d_shockdroplet/silo_hdf5`, via Paraview, Visit, or your other favorite software.
