  Welcome to the home of MFC!
  MFC simulates compressible multi-component and multi-phase flows, amongst other things. 
  It scales ideally to tens of thousands of GPUs on NVIDIA- and AMD-GPU Machines, like OLCF Summit and Frontier.
  As such, it is an exascale CFD codebase.
  MFC is written in Fortran and makes use of metaprogramming to keep the codebase readable.
  Don't hesitate to get in touch with the developers, like <a href="mailto:shb@gatech.edu">Spencer</a>, if you have questions.
  We have an active Slack channel to help ease new MFC users and support development.

  MFC has API and high-level documentation on [its website](https://mflowcode.github.io/).
  The latter is also available [here](docs/documentation/readme.md).
